# 🎛️ ichosynth

### A hand-soldered, low-cost build of TŒRN you play with knobs and a tiny screen

ichosynth runs the **real, unmodified [TŒRN](https://toern.live) firmware** on a Teensy 4.1 — a full
sampler-groovebox-sequencer — but swaps TŒRN's expensive input parts for cheap, solderable ones. No
custom PCB, no fancy parts: just point-to-point hand wiring, four mechanical knobs, three buttons and a
little OLED.

## 🌍 Part of the ICHOS project

`ichosynth` is the instrument participants **build with their own hands** during
**[ICHOS 2026](https://www.francescogiannico.com/ichos-2026/)**, a residential *sound-ecology* workshop
in **Taranto, Italy** (12–14 June 2026), conceived and led by sound artist **Francesco Giannico**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/ichos-project.svg" alt="ICHOS 2026: listening → field recording → building the ichosynth → performance and documentary" width="900">
</p>

> *ichos* — from the ancient Greek **ἦχος**, *"sound"* — is described as a **"non-project"**: three days
> of **listening**, field recording and sonic transformation in Taranto's *marginal* places — border
> zones left out of the postcard, yet dense with sonic and human identity.

The workshop flows from **listening** → **field recording** → **building the instrument** → a **collective
electroacoustic performance**. The sounds captured on site become the raw material this little groovebox
plays back: **you record a place, then perform it as music on an instrument you soldered yourself.**

| Field-recording site | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Circummarpiccolo** | an abandoned 20th-century fish-aquaculture complex |
| **Fiume Galeso** | derelict bathing facilities amid environmental decline |
| **Punta Pizzone** | a Neolithic archaeological site, layered with history |

The synth/sampler build is led by **Luigi Massari** (who also maintains this repository). The experience
culminates in a **sonic documentary** by **Roberta Trani**, premiering at the **Vicoli Corti Festival**
(August 2026); each participant keeps the instrument they built.

## ✨ What ichosynth is

ichosynth is **TŒRN, made buildable by hand**. The firmware is TŒRN's own, unchanged; the project's work
lives entirely in the **three input drivers** that re-create TŒRN's controls out of parts you can solder
on a kitchen table.

| TŒRN's original part | **ichosynth's cheap, solderable replacement** | Driver |
|---|---|---|
| 4× Duppa I²C RGB encoders | 🔁 **4× KY-040** mechanical encoders (turn + push) | [`i2cEncoderLibV2`](teensy/libraries/i2cEncoderLibV2) — re-implements the Duppa API on the `Encoder` library |
| 3× capacitive touch pads | 🔁 **3× tact switches** (PLAY / MENU / REC roles) | [`FastTouch`](teensy/libraries/FastTouch) |
| Encoder RGB-ring feedback | 🔁 **1× I²C SSD1306 OLED** (channel / mode / transport / BPM / volume / page) | [`IchosOled`](teensy/libraries/IchosOled) — a tiny FLASHMEM SSD1306 text driver |

Everything else is pure TŒRN, and **all of it works on this hardware**:

- **8 sample voices + 3 synth voices**, polyphony, per-voice DSP — lowpass filter, **reverb**, bitcrusher,
  detune, octave, and a **Moog ladder** on the synths.
- **16×16 RGB WS2812 sequencer grid** (chainable to 32×16), pattern pages, subpatterns, **song mode**.
- Per-step **velocity / probability / condition**, mute, note-shift, copy-paste.
- **Sample packs + SD browser**, seek / length / reverse, SD load/save.
- **Live recording** (hold REC) with **MIC/LINE input + count-in**.
- **Audio**: a **6.35mm (1/4") mono Line In** to sample/record external gear, instruments or a
  field-recorder straight into the sampler; the output is the on-board **3.5mm stereo headphone jack**.
- **DIN MIDI** clock/notes on pins 34/35 (needs an optional MIDI circuit), EEPROM/SD settings, tap-tempo.

> 🔧 **One feature trimmed for this build:** the optional reactive 2nd LED strip (256 LEDs) is removed,
> which frees pin 24. Everything else in TŒRN is present.

## 🧠 The idea in 30 seconds

The 16×16 panel is your sheet of music. A play-head sweeps left→right; every column it touches plays
whatever notes you drew there. Each **row is a voice** (a sample or a synth), each **column a step**.
Up to **8 sample voices + 3 synth voices** play together; chain pages into patterns, and patterns into
a whole **song**.

## 🔧 How it's wired

ichosynth is **point-to-point hand wiring — no custom PCB.** The pin map below is the TŒRN port; the
authoritative source is the drivers themselves (`ICHOS_ENC_PINS` in
[`i2cEncoderLibV2.h`](teensy/libraries/i2cEncoderLibV2), `ICHOS_BTN_PINS` in
[`FastTouch.h`](teensy/libraries/FastTouch)) plus [`build_toern.py`](teensy/build_toern.py).

| Function | Teensy pin(s) (CLK / DT / SW) |
|---|---|
| **E1** encoder (left) | `5` / `22` / `15` |
| **E2** encoder | `32` / `33` / `41` |
| **E3** encoder | `9` / `14` / `16` |
| **E4** encoder (right) | `37` / `38` / `39` |
| **B1 / B2 / B3** buttons (PLAY / MENU / REC) | `25` / `26` / `28` |
| LED matrix DIN | `17` |
| OLED + audio codec (shared I²C) | `SDA 18` / `SCL 19` |

> 🎛️ The four KY-040 encoders carry TŒRN's full control language (turn + push, context-sensitive per
> mode); the three tact switches take the PLAY / MENU / REC roles of TŒRN's touch pads; hold **REC** to
> **record** from the codec input (MIC or LINE, with count-in). Full step-by-step wiring is in the
> [build manual](BUILD_MANUAL.md).

---

## 📟 The OLED HUD

TŒRN shows status on the RGB rings of its Duppa encoders. KY-040 knobs have no rings, so ichosynth puts
that feedback on a small **SSD1306 0.96" 128×64** screen — **channel · mode · transport · BPM · volume ·
page**. It shares the same I²C bus as the audio codec (different address → no conflict), so it's just
**4 wires**, driven by the bundled [`IchosOled`](teensy/libraries/IchosOled) FLASHMEM text driver.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    T["🧠 Teensy 4.1"] -- "SDA 18 / SCL 19" --> BUS{{"I²C bus"}}
    BUS --> CODEC["🔊 SGTL5000 codec<br/>(audio adaptor)"]
    BUS --> OLED["📟 SSD1306 @ 0x3C"]

    style OLED stroke:#2ea44f,stroke-width:2px
```

| Wire | OLED → Teensy |
|---|---|
| SDA | `→ 18` |
| SCL | `→ 19` |
| VCC | `→ 3V3` |
| GND | `→ GND` |

The HUD is wired in automatically by the build; default I²C address `0x3C` (some panels `0x3D`).

---

## 🚀 Build & flash

The whole port is produced by one script:

```
python teensy/build_toern.py
```

It **clones the TŒRN sources** if they're missing, applies the **pin remap + feature trims**, **wires in
the OLED HUD**, and compiles a flashable **[`teensy/firmware/toern.hex`](teensy/firmware)**. It needs
[`arduino-cli`](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/) and the `teensy:avr` core.

> ⚠️ **Why `-O1`?** The build uses `-O1` (`opt=o1std`), because the default `-O2` crashes the Teensy gcc
> on TŒRN's huge single translation unit. The script sets this for you.

Full details — toolchain, library versions, and the exact remap/trim steps — are in
**[teensy/README.md](teensy/README.md)**.

> 🖱️ **Prefer one click?** A GUI flasher lives in [`_FLASHER/`](_FLASHER) — the existing ichosynth
> flasher — which flashes the built `.hex` to a Teensy 4.1 without the command line.

> 💾 Needs **16 MB of PSRAM (both chips) soldered** to the Teensy 4.1 — it is **mandatory** for the firmware.

## 🙏 Credits & upstream

**ICHOS 2026** is conceived and led by **[Francesco Giannico](https://www.francescogiannico.com/ichos-2026/)**
(sound designer & electroacoustic musician). The `ichosynth` build is led by **Luigi Massari**, with a
sonic documentary by **Roberta Trani**.

On the technical side, ichosynth stands entirely on **SP_ (aka soundpauli)**, who authored **both**
**[TŒRN](https://toern.live)** — the groovebox whose firmware this instrument runs — and the original
**NI404**. Huge thanks also to **Paul Stoffregen / PJRC** for the Teensy platform, and to **Nic
Newdigate** for `teensy-polyphony` / `teensy-variable-playback`, the libraries TŒRN's voices rely on.

> 📜 **A note on history:** this repository began life as a fork of SP_'s **NI404**. That NI404-based
> firmware is still here, but it now serves only as a **fallback / reference** — the product is the
> **TŒRN port** described above.

`ichosynth` is a respectful, additive port: TŒRN's firmware is used **unmodified**, and all original code,
hardware files and design credit remain with SP_. ichosynth only **replaces the input hardware** and adds
the OLED HUD and documentation.

### Libraries used
TŒRN firmware (by SP_, MIT) · Teensy Audio (`Audio.h`) · `teensy-polyphony` / `teensy-variable-playback`
(Nic Newdigate) · `WS2812Serial` · the bundled port drivers `i2cEncoderLibV2` · `FastTouch` · `IchosOled`
